# Breast Cancer Prediction Using ANN
This project provides an interactive web application that predicts whether breast cancer is malignant or benign using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained on the well-known breast cancer dataset and is deployed using Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.

## Features
- Predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
- Input features include a set of measurements derived from breast cancer cell images, such as area, perimeter, concavity, and compactness.
- The application provides the prediction result and the associated probabilities.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To run the project locally, you'll need the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure you have the trained model (`ann_model.joblib`) and scaler (`scaler.joblib`) in the same directory as the application file. You can either use the provided models or train your own using the dataset.

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. The application will open in your browser, and you can start interacting with it by inputting the feature values.

## App Features

The web app consists of the following components:
- **Sidebar Inputs:** The sidebar contains sliders for adjusting the feature values for the breast cancer dataset. These features include:
  - Mean Area
  - Worst Radius
  - Worst Perimeter
  - Mean Perimeter
  - Mean Concavity
  - Worst Area
  - Mean Concave Points
  - Worst Compactness
  - Worst Concave Points
  - Mean Radius

- **Prediction Button:** Once the user adjusts the input values, they can click the "Predict" button to receive the prediction result. The prediction indicates whether the cancer is:
  - Malignant (Cancerous)
  - Benign (Non-cancerous)

- **Probability Output:** The app also displays the probability for each class (malignant and benign).

## Model Details
The model used for prediction is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), trained on the breast cancer dataset. It classifies tumors based on features extracted from cell images. The model has been saved using `joblib` and loaded in the Streamlit app for real-time prediction.

### Model Training
To train the model, you can use the following code:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
import joblib

# Load the dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()

# Split data into features and target
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train the ANN model
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50, 50), max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Save the model and scaler
joblib.dump(model, 'ann_model.joblib')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.joblib')
```

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser after running it with Streamlit.
2. Use the sliders in the sidebar to adjust the values of the features.
3. Click the **Predict** button to see whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
4. View the probability of each prediction (malignant and benign).

## Example Input and Output
### Example Input:
- **Mean Area:** 800.0
- **Worst Radius:** 22.0
- **Worst Perimeter:** 145.0
- **Mean Perimeter:** 90.0
- **Mean Concavity:** 0.2
- **Worst Area:** 1700.0
- **Mean Concave Points:** 0.05
- **Worst Compactness:** 0.3
- **Worst Concave Points:** 0.1
- **Mean Radius:** 14.0

### Example Output:
- **Prediction:** Benign (Non-cancerous)
- **Probability of Malignant:** 0.12
- **Probability of Benign:** 0.88
